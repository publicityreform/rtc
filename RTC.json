    "description": "For <em>Public Supply I</em> Max Neuhaus confined his role as musician to that of a “catalyst for sound-producing activities,” using the largest existing network, the telephone network, which had about 500 million subscribers at the time. Using technology he had constructed himself, he was able to mix calls coming in to ten telephones in the studios of the WBAI radio station in New York in different ways, and then broadcast this melange of listeners' sounds and noises. Once the listeners who called in had switched their radios on, he played with the feedback this produced and bundled sounds from introverted and extroverted callers together. “I realized I could open a large door into the radio studio with the telephone; if I installed telephone lines in the studio, anybody could sonically walk in from any telephone. At that time there were no live call-in shows. […] Although I was not able to articulate it in 1966, now, after having worked with this idea for a long time and talked about it and thought about it, it seems that what these works are really about is proposing to reinstate a kind of music which we have forgotten about and which is perhaps the original impulse for music in man: not making a musical product to be listened to, but forming a dialogue, a dialogue without language, a sound dialogue.”",

    "description": "Radio Net went further than the idea behind Public Supply I. Here again Neuhaus used only the sound from incoming telephone calls as his material, but controlled it with completely automatic mixing desks. He also activated radio technology, in the form of the national loop used by the American NPR Broadcasting Corporation, to process this material aesthetically. Instead of merely transmitting signals from one station to the next, Neuhaus converted the whole system into a closed loop, so that sounds could circulate throughout it. “It created a sound-transformation ‹box› that was literally fifteen hundred miles wide by three thousand miles long with five ins and five outs emerging in Washington. […] even if you do have a frequency shifter and gain control, each loop was in a sense a living thing—they could get out of hand very quickly. […] My role was holding the balance of this big five-looped animal with as little movement as possible.”",

Using a CTS satellite co-owned by NASA and the Canadian government, artists on either side of the country were able to collaborate in real time, with the resulting program broadcast to viewers on Manhattan Cable’s public access channel (MCTV). The project unfolded in two phases, with the first considering the implications of satellite technology and the second a demonstration of its collaborative and artistic possibilities. The artist-participants—Margaret Fisher, Terry Fox, Brad Gibbs, Sharon Grace, Carl Loeffler, Richard Lowenberg, and Alan Scarritt in San Francisco, and Liza Bear, Willoughby Sharp, Keith Sonnier, Richard Landry, Nancy Lewis, Richard Peck, Betty Sussler, Paul Shavelson, and Duff Schweninger in New York—probed the project’s unique conditions of production: Scarritt, for instance, created a feedback loop by pointing a video camera at the television set at the ground station in San Francisco and transmitted the video via the satellite to New York, while dancers Lewis and Fisher responded to each other’s movements from opposite sides of the country. Describing the questions informing Send/Receive, Sonnier and Bear wrote, “What are the implications of simultaneity? Of instant exposure and instant response?”",

The project reflected Adrian’s early insight that the network is not an artistic medium in the traditional sense. Rather, networked art would be defined by exchange—“taking place in the space between machines, only when the machines were on.”",

    "description": "“In early 1983, I was invited to propose a work for the 1983 exhibition <i>Electra: Electricity and Electronics in the Art of the Twentieth Century,</i> organized by Frank Popper for the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. My proposal, La plissure du texte, was a collective global fairy tale, with characters interacting through the ARTEX network, a pre-Web internet used by artists for the creation of a worldwide distributed narrative.  I identified a number of people I’d been working with through the computer, mostly in North America and in Europe, particularly in Holland. I got these people together, as it were, online, and then distributed the characters in a fairy tale, such that eleven locations in the network would represent one character, by whatever means. So in one location, they would develop a story from the point of view of the wicked witch, and then someone somewhere else would be the magician or some other fairy-tale character. And the story emerged in this way, with each group contributing to the narrative and posting updates electronically. So the story would develop over a period of five or six weeks. The work was publicly available in the Musee d’Art Moderne: You’d go to the exhibition and log on and see the story; there was also a printout of it. People would come by and see the story on the screen and sit down and talk with you and suggest, “Why don’t you have so-and-so do this and this?” And you’d say, “Oh, yes. It’s a good idea. Type that in.” [Laughter.] So it became quite socially interactive as well. I’m very proud of it.” ",

Every player can therefore change the sign in his/her square, depending on the overall state of the image, which itself depends on the actions of all the individual players. Out of this cybernetic loop emerges a kind of narrative: autonomous forms, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative, appear in a completely unpredictable manner and tell stories. The Poietic Generator runs on two types of architecture, a centralized network (for versions 1, 3, 4), or an ad hoc distributed network capable of implementing the multicast protocol (case version 2). Therefore, no location in the network plays a particular role and according to the rules of the Poietic Generator, an \"all-all\" interaction may take place without the intervention of any kind of control center.",

    "description": "On September 26, 1991, a group of eight scientists sealed themselves inside a research facility outside of Tucson, Arizona to begin a two-year experiment. Dubbed “Biosphere 2” — Biosphere 1 being the Earth itself — the closed structure contained several different ecosystems, including a desert, rainforest, and coral reef, in which the researchers could investigate the possibility of maintaining human life in outer space. One of those locked inside was Dr. Roy Walford, whose partner at the time was Los Angeles-based artist Barbara T. Smith. While Walford was physically isolated from the world, Smith decided to explore it, embarking on a two-year creative journey that would take her around the globe, from India and Nepal to Germany and Norway, Hawaii and Seattle. She imagined herself a modern-day female version of Homer’s legendary traveller Odysseus, and considered every element of her trip as part of a durational performance, “The 21st Century Odyssey.” Along her route, she would use a videophone and nascent internet technology to connect with Walford in the facility, as well as with collaborators Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz of the Electronic Café International, an early cyber cafe located at 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, which archived these communications.",

As a BBS, and later an email provider and ISP, The Thing fostered a community of practitioners who engaged in experiments with political organizing, writing, performance, and the sale and distribution of artwork online. Including features such as messaging, an anonymized chatroom, and the ability to upload and download files, <em>The Thing</em> BBS initially reached a primarily New York-based community, within reach of local calling rates, but soon grew to include additional nodes in Europe. The project can be considered a platform for contributions by artists and non-artists alike as well as a kind of collectively created social sculpture.",

    "description": "A canary dialogues over a regular phone line with a plant (Philodendron) 600 miles away. n        When this work was shown publicly, the bird and the plant interacted for several hours daily. Humans interacted with the bird and the plant as well. Just by standing next to the plant and the bird, humans immediately altered their behavior. When in close proximity, the interaction was further enhanced by the constantly changing behavior of the bird and the plant, which responded by singing more (bird), activating more sounds (plant), or by remaining quiet. By enabling an isolated and caged animal to have a telematic conversation with a member of another species, this installation dramatized the role of communication and telecommunications in human lives. The inter-species communicative experience observed in the gallery reflects our own longing for interaction, our desire to reach out and stay in touch. This interactive installation is as much about creating art for non-humans as it is about human isolation and loneliness, and about the very possibility of communication. As this piece projects the complexities of electronically mediated human communication over non-human organisms, it surprisingly reveals aspects of our own communicative experience. This interaction is as dynamic and unpredictable as a human dialogue.",

    "title": "Teleporting an Unknown State",
    "description": "Physically, \"Teleporting an Unknown State\" is a relatively simple feedback loop. A seed is planted in a bed of dirt in a dark room. Above it is a data projector. On the Web is a grid of nine squares. In the center is an image from a webcam, also placed above the seed/dirt. When clicked, the other eight black squares display selected webcam images from around the world/Internet--both on the website and on the bed of dirt, via the data projector. By clicking on the grid, the viewer-participant is providing the light for photosynthesis necessary for the seed to grow in the dark room. Conceptually, this simple interaction is a profound statement about the Internet as more than the transmission of representations. It is a life-supporting system. At least metaphorically, it teleports photons (particles not matter), which sustain a living thing. In order to do this, \"Teleporting an Unknown State\" also promotes a social network of participants, who must log on often enough, collectively, to provide the level of projected light necessary for the seedling (a biological not artificial life form) to grow.",

Participants were able to observe the gallery space from the point of view of cameras in the Macowl's eyes. This image of the other, embodied by the Macowl, was dramatized by the fact that viewers temporarily adopted the point of view of the rare bird. One eye was digitized in grayscale (with the freeware Cu-SeeMe) while the other was digitized in color (with the commercial product Enhanced Cu-SeeMe). Those lacking access to more powerful media saw the space in grayscale, those with access to premium technology were able to experience the space in color.",
