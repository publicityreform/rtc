      <strong>What is this?</strong>
      <br /><br />
      This is a minimal archive of artworks that explore
      <em>telepresence</em> as subject matter. Most entries in this archive are
      better documented and discussed elsewhere (see
      <strong>Resources</strong> below); however, I have made an effort to trace the subject matter across parallel art historical lineages, in
      order to map out critical themes, play with technology, and key lines of inquiry surrounding the
      emergent subject of telepresence. The purpose of this site is not to
      emulate or re-create these artworks, nor to provide full context and analysis.
      Instead, assembling a partial, in-progress and post-custodial<sup>1</sup>
      archive‚Äîbuilding on the archival work of other institutions and
      artists‚Äîthis site retains a flexible and curious position in relation
      to the works included.<br /><br />
      As a working definition: <em>Telepresence</em> describes the sensory
      effects associated with the belief that one is experiencing mediated,
      real-time communication between remote participants and/or locations.
      Correspondingly, telepresence artwork may include work that engages technically or conceptually with live-streamed events, chat rooms, virtual interactivity, remote control, and any hybrid mixture of these mechanisms. Telepresence is the sensation of believing that
      one is performing‚Äîand witnessing the effects of‚Äîactions in a remote
      physical reality.<sup>2</sup> Degrees of interactivity, agency, sociality
      and immersiveness contribute to a (shared) sense of telepresence.<sup>3</sup> Telepresence, as seen in these early explorations, suggests that it is possible to spin up a shared version of reality when and where the desire for one exists. 
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Research objectives (initial questions):</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>What would a phenomenology of telepresence include?</li>

        <li>
          What forms (technical, conceptual, aesthetic, political, etc) does telepresence take?
        </li>
        <li>
          How has technology determined our experiences‚Äîof, by, and through
          telepresence?
        </li>
      </ul>

      In consideration of these questions, and in hopes of bringing other
      questions to the surface, this archive looks to artworks that investigate
      problems of embodiment, representation and access‚Äîincluding such themes as
      sharing a virtual body as, or in relation to, individuals and collectives
      (co-embodiment); transitioning between bodies / non-bodies; inhabiting
      assemblages or partial bodies; co/creation of ‚Äúplace‚Äù outside of space or
      time; the limits and possibilities of asymmetric technologies such as those used to surveil or monitor; invention
      and/or erasures of identity; senses of self-efficacy, and the human need
      for social presence. The artworks gathered here do the work of bringing
      other phenomenological modes into the fold‚Äîcyborg, cyber-, and glitch
      feminisms, crip and queer theories, as well as theories of disability,
      dislocation, and diaspora.
      <br /><br />
      In the popular imaginary, telepresence carries themes of recursive
      realities; agential selves moving between bodies or becoming ephemeral;
      co-embodiment; the recording and transfer of sense-memories; perception,
      sensation, and memory that exceed the capacity of a grounded subject; and
      the assemblage and subsequent breakdown of what Ken Goldberg has called
      ‚Äútelepistemology‚Äù<sup>4</sup>‚Äîknowing at a distance, as mediated by
      technology and networks.
      <br /><br />
      Spending time with these artworks is to consider how we have arrived here‚Üí
      sharp ontological differences; perceptual and cognitive distortions of
      time, space, and fact; stateless data bodies, pervasive surveillance, drone warfare‚Ä¶
      as well as fugitive practices which point towards the promise of remote
      intimacy, universal access, and coordinated participation in virtual
      community.
