      <strong>What is this?</strong>
      <br /><br />
      This is a minimal archive of artworks that explore <em>telepresence</em> as subject
      matter. Most entries in this archive are better documented and discussed
      elsewhere (see <strong>Resources</strong> (below) and üîólinksüîó for specific works); however, an effort has
      been made here to trace the subject matter across parallel art historical
      lineages, in order to map out critical themes and key lines of inquiry
      surrounding the emergent subject of telepresence. The purpose of this site
      is not to emulate or re-create these artworks, nor to provide context and
      analysis. Instead, assembling a partial, in-progress and post-custodial<sup>1</sup> archive here‚Äîbuilding on the archival work of other institutions and
      artists‚Äîthis site retains a flexible position of open inquiry in relation
      to the works included. <br /><br />
      As a working definition: <em>Telepresence</em> describes the sensory effects associated with the belief that one is experiencing mediated, real-time communication between remote participants and/or locations. Correspondingly, telepresence may include the sensation of believing that one is performing‚Äîand witnessing the effects of‚Äîactions in a remote physical reality.<sup>2</sup> Degrees of interactivity, agency, sociality and immersiveness contribute to a (shared) sense of telepresence.<sup>3</sup>
<br><br>
      <strong>Research objectives (initial questions):</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>What would a phenomenology of telepresence include?</li>

        <li>
          What forms does telepresence take?
        </li>
        <li>
          How has technology determined our experiences‚Äîof, by, and through
          telepresence?
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      In consideration of these questions, and in hopes of bringing other questions to the surface, this archive looks to artworks that investigate problems of embodiment, representation and access‚Äîincluding such themes as sharing a virtual body as, or in relation to, individuals and collectives (co-embodiment); transitioning between bodies / non-bodies; inhabiting assemblages or partial bodies; co/creation of ‚Äúplace‚Äù outside of space or time; the limits and possibilities of asymmetric technology; invention and/or erasures of identity; senses of self-efficacy, and the human need for social presence. The artworks gathered here do the work of bringing other phenomenological modes into the fold‚Äîcyborg, cyber-, and glitch feminisms, crip and queer theories, as well as theories of disability, dislocation, and diaspora.
<br><br>
In the popular imaginary, telepresence carries themes of recursive realities; agential selves moving between bodies or becoming ephemeral; co-embodiment; the recording and transfer of sense-memories; perception, sensation, and memory that exceed the capacity of a grounded subject; and the assemblage and subsequent breakdown of what Ken Goldberg has called ‚Äútelepistemology‚Äù<sup>4</sup>‚Äîknowing at a distance, as mediated by technology and networks. 
<br><br>
Spending time with these artworks is to consider how we have arrived here ‚Üí sharp ontological differences; perceptual and cognitive distortions of time, space, and fact; stateless data bodies, border walls, surveillance, drone warfare‚Ä¶ and the fugitive practices which point towards the promise of remote intimacy, universal access, and coordinated participation in virtual community.

          <div class="year">1966</div>
          <div class="artist">Max Neuhaus</div>
          <div class="description">
            For Public Supply I Max Neuhaus confined his role as musician to
            that of a ‚Äúcatalyst for sound-producing activities,‚Äù using the
            largest existing network, the telephone network, which had about 500
            million subscribers at the time. Using technology he had constructed
            himself, he was able to mix calls coming in to ten telephones in the
            studios of the WBAI radio station in New York in different ways, and
            then broadcast this melange of listeners' sounds and noises. Once
            the listeners who called in had switched their radios on, he played
            with the feedback this produced and bundled sounds from introverted
            and extroverted callers together. ‚ÄúI realized I could open a large
            door into the radio studio with the telephone; if I installed
            telephone lines in the studio, anybody could sonically walk in from
            any telephone. At that time there were no live call-in shows. [‚Ä¶]
            Although I was not able to articulate it in 1966, now, after having
            worked with this idea for a long time and talked about it and
            thought about it, it seems that what these works are really about is
            proposing to reinstate a kind of music which we have forgotten about
            and which is perhaps the original impulse for music in man: not
            making a musical product to be listened to, but forming a dialogue,
            a dialogue without language, a sound dialogue.‚Äù

            This activity, which was part of the Project Outside Art program,
            was designed to introduce schoolchildren to new communication
            technologies. The artist Robert Whitman developed a series of
            stations equipped with teleprinters and telephones, which the
            children could use at leisure. These stations were set up in the
            north and south ends of New York, thereby linking two areas of the
            city and their respective communities.

          <div class="description">
            Radio Net went further than the idea behind Public Supply I. Here
            again Neuhaus used only the sound from incoming telephone calls as
            his material, but controlled it with completely automatic mixing
            desks. He also activated radio technology, in the form of the
            national loop used by the American NPR Broadcasting Corporation, to
            process this material aesthetically. Instead of merely transmitting
            signals from one station to the next, Neuhaus converted the whole
            system into a closed loop, so that sounds could circulate throughout
            it. ‚ÄúIt created a sound-transformation ‚Äπbox‚Ä∫ that was literally
            fifteen hundred miles wide by three thousand miles long with five
            ins and five outs emerging in Washington. [‚Ä¶] even if you do have a
            frequency shifter and gain control, each loop was in a sense a
            living thing‚Äîthey could get out of hand very quickly. [‚Ä¶] My role
            was holding the balance of this big five-looped animal with as
            little movement as possible.‚Äù<span class="attr">Source: Max Neuhaus, ‚ÄúRundfunkarbeiten und Audium,‚Äù in: Transit

            On September 10 and 11, 1977, the first two-way live broadcast
            between New York and San Francisco take place. Put into position in
            1976, the NASA Satellite CTS is used for the occasion. The New
            York-based station, MCTV, receives a cable signal by satellite.
            Throughout the two-and-a-half hour-long broadcast, the two-way
            telecommunication is the central theme: texts are read, video
            material recorded and discussed. The broadcast reaches almost 25,000
            spectators.

            In 1973 Hershman created Lorna, the first ever artist's interactive

            interact with Lorna by clicking the remote control to trigger
            different sequences about her life. Lorna was, in some senses, a
            virtual counterpart to Hershman's earlier alter ego, Roberta
            Breitmore, for whom she created a quotidian existence, complete with
            bank accounts and diet regimens.

            Live two-way satellite connection using video screens to project
            life-size images. Without public announcement, we installed "Hole in
            Space" in a sidewalk facing window at New York City's Lincoln Center
            and in a display window at at the Broadway department store in
            Century City ( Los Angeles). Both screens could accommodate the
            images of about 15 people. People could converse with people in the
            other city as if they were standing on the same street corner. "Hole
            in Space" took place over three evenings. On the first night, people
            simply discovered it. They used pay-phones of phoned from home to
            tell friends in the other city to meet them. They all showed up for
            the second evening, when it also was announced on TV in both
            locations. On the third night, families from miles away drove into
            the cities with cars full of kids to meet up with relatives on the
            other coast whom they hadn't seen in years.

            a networked happening that linked sixteen cities worldwide, with the
            media art festival Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria acting as the
            central node. Each site was given one hour‚Äîcoinciding with midday,
            local time‚Äîin which to generate and transmit content over a wide
            range of devices and networks, including computer terminals, phone,
            fax, and slow-scan TV. The project reflected Adrian‚Äôs early insight
            that the network is not an artistic medium in the traditional sense.
            Rather, networked art would be defined by exchange‚Äî‚Äútaking place in
            the space between machines, only when the machines were on.‚Äù

            Every player draws on a small part of a global mosaic, which is
            manipulated by all the participants. Every player can therefore
            change the sign in his/her square, depending on the overall state of
            the image, which itself depends on the actions of all the individual
            players. Out of this cybernetic loop emerges a kind of narrative:
            autonomous forms, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative, appear
            in a completely unpredictable manner and tell stories. The Poietic
            Generator runs on two types of architecture, a centralized network
            (for versions 1, 3, 4), or an ad hoc distributed network capable of
            implementing the multicast protocol (case version 2). Therefore, no
            location in the network plays a particular role and according to the
            rules of the Poietic Generator, an "all-all" interaction may take
            place without the intervention of any kind of control center.

          <div class="description">
            On September 26, 1991, a group of eight scientists sealed themselves
            inside a research facility outside of Tucson, Arizona to begin a
            two-year experiment. Dubbed ‚ÄúBiosphere 2‚Äù ‚Äî Biosphere 1 being the
            Earth itself ‚Äî the closed structure contained several different
            ecosystems, including a desert, rainforest, and coral reef, in which
            the researchers could investigate the possibility of maintaining
            human life in outer space. One of those locked inside was Dr. Roy
            Walford, whose partner at the time was Los Angeles-based artist
            Barbara T. Smith. While Walford was physically isolated from the
            world, Smith decided to explore it, embarking on a two-year creative
            journey that would take her around the globe, from India and Nepal
            to Germany and Norway, Hawaii and Seattle. She imagined herself a
            modern-day female version of Homer‚Äôs legendary traveller Odysseus,
            and considered every element of her trip as part of a durational
            performance, ‚ÄúThe 21st Century Odyssey.‚Äù Along her route, she would
            use a videophone and nascent internet technology to connect with
            Walford in the facility, as well as with collaborators Kit Galloway
            and Sherrie Rabinowitz of the Electronic Caf√© International, an
            early cyber cafe located at 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica,
            which archived these communications.

          <div class="year">1991-ongoing</div>

          <div class="description">
            Founded in New York City in 1991, The Thing originated as a Bulletin
            Board System (BBS)‚Äîan early type of online forum‚Äîfocusing on
            contemporary art and cultural theory. As a BBS, and later an email
            provider and ISP, The Thing fostered a community of practitioners
            who engaged in experiments with political organizing, writing,
            performance, and the sale and distribution of artwork online.
            Including features such as messaging, an anonymized chatroom, and
            the ability to upload and download files, The Thing BBS initially
            reached a primarily New York-based community, within reach of local
            calling rates, but soon grew to include additional nodes in Europe.
            The project can be considered a platform for contributions by
            artists and non-artists alike as well as a kind of collectively
            created social sculpture.

            A canary dialogues over a regular phone line with a plant
            (Philodendron) 600 miles away. When this work was shown publicly,
            the bird and the plant interacted for several hours daily. Humans
            interacted with the bird and the plant as well. Just by standing
            next to the plant and the bird, humans immediately altered their
            behavior. When in close proximity, the interaction was further
            enhanced by the constantly changing behavior of the bird and the
            plant, which responded by singing more (bird), activating more
            sounds (plant), or by remaining quiet. By enabling an isolated and
            caged animal to have a telematic conversation with a member of
            another species, this installation dramatized the role of
            communication and telecommunications in human lives. The
            inter-species communicative experience observed in the gallery
            reflects our own longing for interaction, our desire to reach out
            and stay in touch. This interactive installation is as much about
            creating art for non-humans as it is about human isolation and
            loneliness, and about the very possibility of communication. As this
            piece projects the complexities of electronically mediated human
            communication over non-human organisms, it surprisingly reveals
            aspects of our own communicative experience. This interaction is as
            dynamic and unpredictable as a human dialogue.

          <div class="description">
            Physically, "Teleporting an Unknown State" is a relatively simple
            feedback loop. A seed is planted in a bed of dirt in a dark room.
            Above it is a data projector. On the Web is a grid of nine squares.
            In the center is an image from a webcam, also placed above the
            seed/dirt. When clicked, the other eight black squares display
            selected webcam images from around the world/Internet--both on the
            website and on the bed of dirt, via the data projector. By clicking
            on the grid, the viewer-participant is providing the light for
            photosynthesis necessary for the seed to grow in the dark room.
            Conceptually, this simple interaction is a profound statement about
            the Internet as more than the transmission of representations. It is
            a life-supporting system. At least metaphorically, it teleports
            photons (particles not matter), which sustain a living thing. In
            order to do this, "Teleporting an Unknown State" also promotes a
            social network of participants, who must log on often enough,
            collectively, to provide the level of projected light necessary for
            the seedling (a biological not artificial life form) to grow.

          <div class="description">
            Local and remote participants experienced a large aviary with 30
            birds from the point of view of a telerobotic macaw. Inside the
            aviary the viewer noticed a strong contrast between the thirty
            flying birds (zebra finches, which were very small and mostly gray)
            and the large tropical macaw, which was perched and immobile. This
            macaw, like any other, has a long saber-shaped tail, a curved
            powerful bill, and brilliant plumage. Upon observing the behavior of
            the birds, the viewer noticed that the macaw -- the most commanding
            bird in the aviary -- appeared motionless. Only its head moved. This
            tropical bird was in fact a telerobot. Since the macaw's eyes were
            on the front of the head, as is the case of an owl, the telerobot
            was called a Macowl . The head of the telerobotic macowl is made of
            a pair of color video cameras and a computer-controlled servo. The
            servo-motor which moves the telerobot's head is controlled by a PC
            receiving directional information from the virtual reality headset.
            The viewer was invited to put on the headset. While wearing the
            headset, the viewer was transported into the aviary. The viewer now
            perceived the aviary from the point of view of the Macowl and was
            able to observe himself or herself in this situation from the point
            of view of the macaw. The tropical bird's eyes are two CCD cameras.
            When the viewer, now a participant, moved his or her head to left
            and right, the head of the telerobotic Macowl moved accordingly,
            enabling the participant to see the whole space of the aviary from
            the Macowl's point of view. The real space was immediately
            transformed into a virtual space. The installation was permanently
            connected to the Internet. Through the Net, remote participants
            observed the gallery space from the point of view of the telerobotic
            Macowl. Through the Internet remote participants also used their
            microphones to trigger the vocal apparatus of the telerobotic macaw
            heard in the gallery. The body of telerobotic Macowl was shared in
            real time by local participants and Internet participants worldwide.
            Sounds in the space, usually a combination of human and bird voices,
            traveled back to remote participants on the Internet. By enabling
            the local participant to be both vicariously inside and physically
            outside the cage, this installation created a metaphor that revealed
            how new communications technology enables the effacement of
            boundaries at the same time that it reaffirms them. The installation
            also addressed issues of identity and alterity, projecting the
            viewer inside the body of a rare bird who not only was the only one
            of its kind in the aviary but was also distinctly different from the
            other birds (in scale, color, and behavior). The piece can be seen
            as a critique of the problematic notion of "exoticism", a concept
            that reveals more about relativity of contexts and the limited
            awareness of the observer than about the cultural status of the
            object of observation. This image of "the different", "the other",
            embodied by the telerobotic Macowl, was dramatized by the fact that
            the participant temporarily adopted the point of view of the rare
            bird. This piece created a self-organizing system of mutual
            dependence, in which local participants, animals, a telerobot, and
            remote participants interacted without direct guidance, control, or
            external intervention. As the piece combined physical and
            non-physical entities, it merged immediate perceptual phenomena with
            a heightened awareness of what affects us but is visually absent,
            physically remote. Local and on-line participants experienced the
            space in complex, different ways. The local ecology of the aviary
            was affected by Internet ecology and vice-versa. The topology of
            Rara Avis was carefully designed to expose the social gap implied in
            technological development. As the video feed, from the point of view
            of the Macowl (as seen by a local participant), went out from the
            Atlanta space into the Internet, one eye was digitized in grayscale
            (with the freeware Cu-SeeMe) while the other was digitized in color
            (with the commercial product Enhanced Cu-SeeMe). While anyone with
            Internet access could download the freeware and participate in the
            interactive component of the work, full participation in color was
            only accessible to those who had already purchased the commercial
            version of the freeware. The gray images were subsequently and
            automatically uploaded to the Rara Avis Web site, where they became
            even more accessible--since more people today have access to (and
            feel comfortable with) the Web than to videoconferencing on the
            Internet. The color feed was re-routed to the MBone, the
            multicasting zone of the Net, which only a much smaller group of
            individuals can access at present. Those lacking access to more
            powerful media saw the space in Atlanta in grayscale, at speeds that
            depended on the software, hardware, and connectivity available to
            them. Those with access to newer technology were able to experience
            the space differently, in color and at frame rates that reflected
            the processing power and bandwidth available to them. In its
            geographic dispersal, Rara Avis was intentionally never exactly the
            same to remote or local participants. The merger of local ecology
            with the cybersphere was perceived in varying ways by viewers and
            participants worldwide, depending on the kind of access they had.
            This clearly suggested that the mediascape--the highly technological
            environment in which we live--modulates and defines our perception
            of reality. Which makes us realize the inequalities promoted by
            technology, and, more importantly, that reality is negotiation, and
            that it is never the same for everybody.

            answer a number of questions, such as 'What is palpable of the

            sincerity, what is real and what is not, in environments like IRC

            question-and-answer sessions, she tried to establish if people could
            recognize her, out of four users called Annie. The results suggest
            that normal aspects of subjectivity, such as personality and
