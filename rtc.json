    "description": "For <em>Public Supply I</em> Max Neuhaus confined his role as musician to that of a “catalyst for sound-producing activities,” using the largest existing network, the telephone network, which had about 500 million subscribers at the time. Using technology he had constructed himself, he was able to mix calls coming in to ten telephones in the studios of the WBAI radio station in New York in different ways, and then broadcast this melange of listeners' sounds and noises. Once the listeners who called in had switched their radios on, he played with the feedback this produced and bundled sounds from introverted and extroverted callers together.nn“I realized I could open a large door into the radio studio with the telephone; if I installed telephone lines in the studio, anybody could sonically walk in from any telephone. At that time there were no live call-in shows. […] Although I was not able to articulate it in 1966, now, after having worked with this idea for a long time and talked about it and thought about it, it seems that what these works are really about is proposing to reinstate a kind of music which we have forgotten about and which is perhaps the original impulse for music in man: not making a musical product to be listened to, but forming a dialogue, a dialogue without language, a sound dialogue.”",

    "description": "Radio Net went further than the idea behind Public Supply I. Here again Neuhaus used only the sound from incoming telephone calls as his material, but controlled it with completely automatic mixing desks. He also activated radio technology, in the form of the national loop used by the American NPR Broadcasting Corporation, to process this material aesthetically. Instead of merely transmitting signals from one station to the next, Neuhaus converted the whole system into a closed loop, so that sounds could circulate throughout it. “It created a sound-transformation ‹box› that was literally fifteen hundred miles wide by three thousand miles long with five ins and five outs emerging in Washington. […] even if you do have a frequency shifter and gain control, each loop was in a sense a living thing—they could get out of hand very quickly. […] My role was holding the balance of this big five-looped animal with as little movement as possible.”",

Each site was given one hour—coinciding with midday, local time—in which to generate and transmit content over a wide range of devices and networks, including computer terminals, phone, fax, and slow-scan TV. The project reflected Adrian’s early insight that the network is not an artistic medium in the traditional sense. Rather, networked art would be defined by exchange—“taking place in the space between machines, only when the machines were on.”",

Every player can therefore change the sign in his/her square, depending on the overall state of the image, which itself depends on the actions of all the individual players. Out of this cybernetic loop emerges a kind of narrative: autonomous forms, sometimes abstract, sometimes figurative, appear in a completely unpredictable manner and tell stories. The Poietic Generator runs on two types of architecture, a centralized network (for versions 1, 3, 4), or an ad hoc distributed network capable of implementing the multicast protocol (case version 2). Therefore, no location in the network plays a particular role and according to the rules of the Poietic Generator, an \"all-all\" interaction may take place without the intervention of any kind of control center.",

    "description": "On September 26, 1991, a group of eight scientists sealed themselves inside a research facility outside of Tucson, Arizona to begin a two-year experiment. Dubbed “Biosphere 2” — Biosphere 1 being the Earth itself — the closed structure contained several different ecosystems, including a desert, rainforest, and coral reef, in which the researchers could investigate the possibility of maintaining human life in outer space. One of those locked inside was Dr. Roy Walford, whose partner at the time was Los Angeles-based artist Barbara T. Smith. While Walford was physically isolated from the world, Smith decided to explore it, embarking on a two-year creative journey that would take her around the globe, from India and Nepal to Germany and Norway, Hawaii and Seattle. She imagined herself a modern-day female version of Homer’s legendary traveller Odysseus, and considered every element of her trip as part of a durational performance, “The 21st Century Odyssey.” Along her route, she would use a videophone and nascent internet technology to connect with Walford in the facility, as well as with collaborators Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz of the Electronic Café International, an early cyber cafe located at 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, which archived these communications. https://cdn.glitch.com/95e2d5bd-7f2f-4e48-9362-a944941983a6%2F21stcenturyodyssey-520x379.png?v=1606229866734",

As a BBS, and later an email provider and ISP, The Thing fostered a community of practitioners who engaged in experiments with political organizing, writing, performance, and the sale and distribution of artwork online. Including features such as messaging, an anonymized chatroom, and the ability to upload and download files, <em>The Thing</em> BBS initially reached a primarily New York-based community, within reach of local calling rates, but soon grew to include additional nodes in Europe. The project can be considered a platform for contributions by artists and non-artists alike as well as a kind of collectively created social sculpture.",

    "description": "A canary dialogues over a regular phone line with a plant (Philodendron) 600 miles away. n        When this work was shown publicly, the bird and the plant interacted for several hours daily. Humans interacted with the bird and the plant as well. Just by standing next to the plant and the bird, humans immediately altered their behavior. When in close proximity, the interaction was further enhanced by the constantly changing behavior of the bird and the plant, which responded by singing more (bird), activating more sounds (plant), or by remaining quiet. By enabling an isolated and caged animal to have a telematic conversation with a member of another species, this installation dramatized the role of communication and telecommunications in human lives. The inter-species communicative experience observed in the gallery reflects our own longing for interaction, our desire to reach out and stay in touch. This interactive installation is as much about creating art for non-humans as it is about human isolation and loneliness, and about the very possibility of communication. As this piece projects the complexities of electronically mediated human communication over non-human organisms, it surprisingly reveals aspects of our own communicative experience. This interaction is as dynamic and unpredictable as a human dialogue.",

    "description": "Physically, \"Teleporting an Unknown State\" is a relatively simple feedback loop. A seed is planted in a bed of dirt in a dark room. Above it is a data projector. On the Web is a grid of nine squares. In the center is an image from a webcam, also placed above the seed/dirt. When clicked, the other eight black squares display selected webcam images from around the world/Internet--both on the website and on the bed of dirt, via the data projector. By clicking on the grid, the viewer-participant is providing the light for photosynthesis necessary for the seed to grow in the dark room. Conceptually, this simple interaction is a profound statement about the Internet as more than the transmission of representations. It is a life-supporting system. At least metaphorically, it teleports photons (particles not matter), which sustain a living thing. In order to do this, \"Teleporting an Unknown State\" also promotes a social network of participants, who must log on often enough, collectively, to provide the level of projected light necessary for the seedling (a biological not artificial life form) to grow.",

    "title": "Rara Avis",
    "description": "Local and remote participants experienced a large aviary with 30 birds from the point of view of a telerobotic macaw. Inside the aviary the viewer noticed a strong contrast between the thirty flying birds (zebra finches, which were very small and mostly gray) and the large tropical macaw, which was perched and immobile. This macaw, like any other, has a long saber-shaped tail, a curved powerful bill, and brilliant plumage. Upon observing the behavior of the birds, the viewer noticed that the macaw -- the most commanding bird in the aviary -- appeared motionless. Only its head moved. This tropical bird was in fact a telerobot. Since the macaw's eyes were on the front of the head, as is the case of an owl, the telerobot was called a Macowl . The head of the telerobotic macowl is made of a pair of color video cameras and a computer-controlled servo. The servo-motor which moves the telerobot's head is controlled by a PC receiving directional information from the virtual reality headset. The viewer was invited to put on the headset. While wearing the headset, the viewer was transported into the aviary. The viewer now perceived the aviary from the point of view of the Macowl and was able to observe himself or herself in this situation from the point of view of the macaw. The tropical bird's eyes are two CCD cameras. When the viewer, now a participant, moved his or her head to left and right, the head of the telerobotic Macowl moved accordingly, enabling the participant to see the whole space of the aviary from the Macowl's point of view. The real space was immediately transformed into a virtual space. The installation was permanently connected to the Internet. Through the Net, remote participants observed the gallery space from the point of view of the telerobotic Macowl. Through the Internet remote participants also used their microphones to trigger the vocal apparatus of the telerobotic macaw heard in the gallery. The body of telerobotic Macowl was shared in real time by local participants and Internet participants worldwide. Sounds in the space, usually a combination of human and bird voices, traveled back to remote participants on the Internet. By enabling the local participant to be both vicariously inside and physically outside the cage, this installation created a metaphor that revealed how new communications technology enables the effacement of boundaries at the same time that it reaffirms them. The installation also addressed issues of identity and alterity, projecting the viewer inside the body of a rare bird who not only was the only one of its kind in the aviary but was also distinctly different from the other birds (in scale, color, and behavior). The piece can be seen as a critique of the problematic notion of \"exoticism\", a concept that reveals more about relativity of contexts and the limited awareness of the observer than about the cultural status of the object of observation. This image of \"the different\", \"the other\", embodied by the telerobotic Macowl, was dramatized by the fact that the participant temporarily adopted the point of view of the rare bird. This piece created a self-organizing system of mutual dependence, in which local participants, animals, a telerobot, and remote participants interacted without direct guidance, control, or external intervention. As the piece combined physical and non-physical entities, it merged immediate perceptual phenomena with a heightened awareness of what affects us but is visually absent, physically remote. Local and on-line participants experienced the space in complex, different ways. The local ecology of the aviary was affected by Internet ecology and vice-versa. The topology of Rara Avis was carefully designed to expose the social gap implied in technological development. As the video feed, from the point of view of the Macowl (as seen by a local participant), went out from the Atlanta space into the Internet, one eye was digitized in grayscale (with the freeware Cu-SeeMe) while the other was digitized in color (with the commercial product Enhanced Cu-SeeMe). While anyone with Internet access could download the freeware and participate in the interactive component of the work, full participation in color was only accessible to those who had already purchased the commercial version of the freeware. The gray images were subsequently and automatically uploaded to the Rara Avis Web site, where they became even more accessible--since more people today have access to (and feel comfortable with) the Web than to videoconferencing on the Internet. The color feed was re-routed to the MBone, the multicasting zone of the Net, which only a much smaller group of individuals can access at present. Those lacking access to more powerful media saw the space in Atlanta in grayscale, at speeds that depended on the software, hardware, and connectivity available to them. Those with access to newer technology were able to experience the space differently, in color and at frame rates that reflected the processing power and bandwidth available to them. In its geographic dispersal, Rara Avis was intentionally never exactly the same to remote or local participants. The merger of local ecology with the cybersphere was perceived in varying ways by viewers and participants worldwide, depending on the kind of access they had. This clearly suggested that the mediascape--the highly technological environment in which we live--modulates and defines our perception of reality. Which makes us realize the inequalities promoted by technology, and, more importantly, that reality is negotiation, and that it is never the same for everybody.",

Using fifteen-minute question-and-answer sessions, she tried to establish if people could recognize her, out of four users called Annie. The results suggest that normal aspects of subjectivity, such as personality and opinions, become neutralized in many online venues.",
